          Margaret Heafield was born to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth Esther Heafield (n√©e Partington).[5] She graduated from Hancock High School in 1954, and earned a B.A. in mathematics with a minor in philosophy from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earlham_College">Earlham College</a> in 1958.[6] After graduation, she briefly taught high school math and French while her husband finished earning his undergraduate degree. She moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston">Boston, Massachusetts</a>, with the intention of doing graduate study in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics">bstract mathematics</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandeis_University">Brandeis University</a>. In 1960 she took an interim position at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT">MIT</a> to develop software for predicting weather on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGP-30">LGP-30</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-1">PDP-1</a> computers (at
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky">Marvin Minsky's</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Computer_Science_and_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory#Project_MAC">Project MAC</a>) for professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton_Lorenz">Edward Norton Lorenz</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology">meteorology</a> department.[1][7] At that time, computer science and software engineering were not yet disciplines; instead, programmers learned on the job with hands-on experience.[2]

        <p>
          From 1961 to 1963, she worked on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Automatic_Ground_Environment">SAGE Project</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Lincoln_Laboratory">Lincoln Labs</a>, where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/FSQ-7_Combat_Direction_Central">AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1)</a>, to search for "unfriendly" aircraft; she also wrote software for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Cambridge_Research_Laboratories">Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories</a>.
